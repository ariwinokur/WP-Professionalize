# WP-Professionalize
WP Professionalize WordPress Plugin

This is a plugin still very much under development.  At this point, it is my attempt to create a plugin using my training in programming hands-on.  The purpose of the plugin is to allow a website designer to tweak a number of WordPress features to cleanup and hide certain things that a professional client may be turned off by.  

THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS!  ANY USE OF THIS PLUGIN ON YOUR SITE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.  IF IT CAUSES DAMAGE TO YOUR SITE, I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY!
